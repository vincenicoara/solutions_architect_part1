### How to set up:
- Run `npm install`

### How to run:
There are two ways to run this program.

1) Run `npm run start <filename>`. 
- It looks for "filename" in the "/input/" folder. Please place your input file there before running. 

1) Run `npm run start`
- If no filename is provided, it automatically uses the file "/input/input.txt". You can also paste your file in this one before you run. 

Note: All of the above commands must be run in the highest level project directory (where main.js is)

### How to run tests:
- Run `npm run tests`
