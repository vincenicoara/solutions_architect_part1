### How to set up:
- Run `npm install`

### How to run:
There are two ways to run this program.
1) Run `npm run start`
- The above method will automatically read the file in "/input/input.txt", so you would have to paste your desired file in this one. 
2) Run `npm run start <filename>`. 
- When you provide the filename, it automatically looks in the "/input/" folder, so you will need to place it there beforehand for this command to run successfully. 

Note: All of the above commands must be run in the highest level project directory (where main.js is)

### How to run tests:
- Run `npm run tests`
